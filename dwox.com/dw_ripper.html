<p>Sorry,&nbsp;<br>
but actually i have no time
</tt>
<tt>
to write more words<br>
 or to check my english (Thanks to Bud for doing<br>
a quick review)</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>It was not easy to find machines with all these<br>
different PB Versions and some test files.<br>
The one with 100 Mhz and PB5 was cool.<br>
Yes! The old &quot;debugger&quot; runs nice and I detected<br>
a bug in PB5. Or is it just a different behavior.<br>
never mind...who cares....<br>
<br>
Perhaps dw_ripper is a &quot;one shot</tt><tt>&quot;</tt><tt> and someone else<br>
grabs the idea for commercial use.<br>
<br>
So I will try to review the source code and make<br>
it public. Can I really? Is this allowed?<br>
<br>
1998 was the first time I walked into the desert<br>
of HexCode, looking into a PBL to inspect the part<br>
where the Checkout-Flags broke down..&nbsp;<br>
Then came e-crane and made a commercial product.<br>
Too late for me, because I had to do other work.<br>
They wrote this PBL-Repair kit.. ybrowser came<br>
out and showed some hacking. Nice work!<br>
<br>
Why the hell is the PBL File Format not published?<br>
<br>
This year might be the year of truth....</tt></p>
