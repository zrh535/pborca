Introduction:
-------------
Libtool is a small utility that reads PowerBuilder Libraries
or other PowerBuilder generated files like PBDs, DLLs and EXEs.

It comes with enhanced dump capabilities and can display
SCC/Checked-Out Informations that are stored within a
PBL (pre PB 8).

In conjunction with dw_ripper (www.dwox.com) it is possible
to restore the Datawindow Syntax from compiled Datawindows
(PBD/DLL/EXE).

In conjunction with Filemon (www.sysinternals.com) you can
open a LOG file (captured by Filemon) with libtool to
analyse the libary/object accesses. (Highly recommended experience;-))

Libtool can _not_ recompile any P-Code (you have to use another tool).

With "expert" knowlegde you can recover (export) recently deleted
objects by using the export from the "Xref.." View.
Hint: Find the first (unreferenced) datablock that matches
to be the start of your deleted object and export from there.
(Use a Filter to find the candidates.)

Setup and Configuration:
--------------------------------------
- Create a directory (like c:\program\libtool).
- Copy the files libtool.exe and ms_rte.dll into
  that directory.
- Be sure that libtool can create a new file (libtool.ini)
  in that directory (libtool home directory) during runtime.

An extra TEMP-Directory for Libtool is recomended because some
temporarily created files will not be deleted after
use.  Also because there is no warning prompt before overwriting an
existing file with the same name ("Export and Run..."-Feature).

See also information in Menu -> Tools -> Preferences.

Libtool was compiled with PowerBuilder 8.0.3 and comes with a
separate DLL (ms_rte.dll). This DLL is used to display the
"Block Dump" data view in a MS Richtext Control.


Other program features :
------------------------
(You need the Right Mouse Button to access most of this functions!)

FileDrop:
      Drag and Drop Files into the Libtool window.

Export:
      Exports "raw" data from a Library.

Export and Run:
      Exports an entry (file) to the TEMP-Directory and opens this
      with its default assigned application (simple "run filename").
      The File resides in this directory, so an extra TEMP-Directory
      is recomended to avoid conflicts.
      (See Configuration).

Dump Block:
      Hex/Ascii Block Viewer for PB Files.

XRef:
      Shows what Objects/Meta Information can be found in the blocks
      of a PBL.

Filemon transformation:
      Analyses a Filemon captured LOG File and shows to what
      file segments this can be referenced. Simply open a *.LOG file.


Filemon transformation
----------------------
Filemon tracks how many bytes are read at which position during
runtime. Libtool analyses this information and shows, which objects
are stored in the accessed file segments.

For example:
Offset: 28160  Length: 4086  -> "HDR*, FRE*, NOD*" blocks were read.
Offset: 678560 Length: 16384 -> "object a, object b" can be found
                                in this segment. "object a" was loaded.
Known bugs:
-----------
I am not sure that the datetime conversations will work properly
in all regions of the world. (southern hemisphere...)

Feel free to send an email if you find any errors to
arnd.schmidt@dwox.com.


Planned functions and features:
-------------------------------
ReWrite corrupted SCC Flags.
Easy Export of Source for recently deleted objects (if they
are still in the PBL).
Fragmentation Analyse Viewer.

Core components will become "Open Source" under Sybase Code Exchange
or elsewhere. (Planned for 2003)


Attention
---------
Please do not modify a PBL/PBD/EXE/DLL with tools other
than Powerbuilder or an "official" 3rd Party Tool.

If you are going to modify a file with another tool, be sure
that you have a valid and actual backup of the file even though
the file might already be corrupted.
